# Voting Machine Fraud in the State of New York

## Results

NY only has 5% statewide turnout in their dataset for the 2020 General Election. So, results will be postponed until NY can update their data.

## Setup

Requires python3. Before running, be sure you have enough free space for the downloaded and decompressed CSV files, about 8.8 GB.

## Running

1. Download voter data (see 'Data Source' section).
2. Move and rename decompressed txt file to `./data/voters.txt`.
3. To plot voter turnout lines vs. age for all counties on the same plot: `./plot_turnout_by_age.py`.

## Data Source

New York voter data is free, but you must make a request, be approved, and then recieve a physical CD.
